# COVID-Risk-Estimation
With the emergence of highly contagious COVID-19 variants such a the Delta Variant, there has been a renewed debate about masks, vaccines, and the risks of reopening. So we created this [notebook](https://github.com/Neptune726/COVID-Risk-Estimation/blob/main/covid-risk-estimation.ipynb) for rough estimation of the probability of contracting COVID given various factors, such as the number of contacts per day, vaccine status, etc. 

The binder link for this notebook is:

Instructions are in the notebook, they can also be found here: https://github.com/Neptune726/COVID-Risk-Estimation/blob/main/Instructions.pdf

The methdology is detailed in the notebook as well, it can also be found here: https://github.com/Neptune726/COVID-Risk-Estimation/blob/main/methodology.pdf
