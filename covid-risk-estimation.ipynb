On the left side there are two boxes, one for the variant of COVID (either Delta, Alpha, or the Original Strain), and one for the mitigation methods (Mask and/or Vaccine). Below the plot there are four sliders:\n- **Time Period** The time period (in days) over which we are calculating the probability of contracting COVID. (by default this is 180 days (so a school year)).\n- **Active COVID Cases per 100k** This slider is in log scale so it is easier to tune for smaller number of active cases.\n- **Average hours Interacting with each Contact** The average number of hours spent interacting with each contact.\n- **Vaccine Effectiveness** The effectivness of the vaccine, ie: the reduction in risk for a person with the vaccine vs someone without.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"n_contacts=np.arange(100)\n\nnum_hours=1.0\nCOVID_concentration=0.1\nr_vax=r_pfizer_delta_3does\nmask=True\nvax=True\nvariant=\"Delta\"\ntime_period=180 #days\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12,10),facecolor=\"lightgrey\")\nplt.subplots_adjust(left=0.35, bottom=0.5)\n\n\nOline,=plt.plot(n_contacts,\n        P_catch_per_time_period(P_contract(T_estimate(R0=R0_delta),\n                   COVID_concentration,num_hours,\n                   c=n_contacts),time_period),label=\"Un Mitigated\")\n\nMline,=plt.plot(n_contacts,\n        P_catch_per_time_period(P_contract(calculate_T_reduced(T_estimate(R0=R0_delta),np.array([r_vax,r_mask])),\n                   COVID_concentration,num_hours,\n                   c=n_contacts),time_period),label=\"Mitigated\")\nplt.legend(loc=\"upper left\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Number of Contacts per day\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Probability of Contracting COVID\\nin a Time Period\")\nplt.ylim(0,1)\nplt.grid()\n\naxCon = plt.axes([0.25, 0.25, 0.65, 0.03])\naxHour = plt.axes([0.25, 0.15, 0.65, 0.03])\naxTime = plt.axes([0.25, 0.35, 0.65, 0.03])\n\naxVax = plt.axes([0.25, 0.05, 0.65, 0.03])\n\naxVar = plt.axes([0.05, 0.7, 0.2, 0.15])\naxVar.text(0.5,1.1,\"Variant\",ha=\"center\")\n\naxMit = plt.axes([0.05, 0.45, 0.2, 0.15],facecolor=\"orange\")\naxMit.text(0.5,1.1,\"Mitigation Methods\",ha=\"center\")\n\nsCon = Slider(axCon, 'Active COVID Cases\\nper 100k', \n              np.log(1), np.log(10**5), valinit=np.log(COVID_concentration*10**5))\nsCon.valtext.set_text(int(COVID_concentration*10**5))\n\nsHour = Slider(axHour, 'Average hours\\nInteracting with\\neach Contact', \n              0.1, 4, valinit=num_hours)\n\nsVax= Slider(axVax, \"Vaccine Effectiveness\",\n            0,1,valinit=r_pfizer_delta_3does)\n\nsTime= Slider(axTime,\"Time Period (days)\",1,365,valinit=time_period)\n\n\naxVax.axvline(r_pfizer,color=\"black\")\naxVax.text(r_pfizer,1.2,\"Pfizer Original Strain\",ha=\"center\")\n\naxVax.axvline(r_pfizer_delta_3does,color=\"black\")\naxVax.text(r_pfizer_delta_3does,-0.1,\"Pfizer Delta Variant (3 dose)\",\n           va=\"top\",ha=\"center\")\n\naxVax.axvline(r_pfizer_delta,color=\"black\")\naxVax.text(r_pfizer_delta,1.2,\"Pfizer Delta Variant (2 dose)\",\n           ha=\"center\")\n\nVariant_radio=RadioButtons(axVar, ('Delta', 'Alpha', 'Original Strain'))\n\nMitigation_checkbox=CheckButtons(axMit, [\"Vaccine\",\"Mask\"], [vax,mask])\n\n\n\ndef set_variant(label):\n    global variant\n    variant=label\n    update(0)\n    \ndef set_mitigation(label):\n    global vax, mask\n    \n    if label==\"Vaccine\":\n        vax=not vax\n    if label==\"Mask\":\n        mask=not mask\n    update(0)\n    \ndef update(val):\n    \n    Concentration = np.exp(sCon.val)/10**5\n    sCon.valtext.set_text(int(Concentration*10**5))\n    num_hours=float(sHour.val)\n    r_vax=sVax.val\n    time_period=sTime.val\n    \n    if variant==\"Delta\":\n        T=T_estimate(R0=R0_delta)\n    if variant==\"Alpha\":\n        T=T_estimate(R0=R0_alpha)\n    if variant==\"Original Strain\":\n        T=T_estimate()\n    \n    Mitigations=[]\n    if vax:\n        Mitigations.append(r_vax)\n    if mask:\n        Mitigations.append(r_mask)\n        \n    Oline.set_ydata(P_catch_per_time_period(P_contract(T,\n                   Concentration,num_hours,\n                   c=n_contacts),time_period))\n    \n    Mline.set_ydata(P_catch_per_time_period(\n        P_contract(calculate_T_reduced(T,np.array([Mitigations])),\n                   Concentration,num_hours,\n                   c=n_contacts),time_period))\n    \n    fig.canvas.draw_idle()\n\nMitigation_checkbox.on_clicked(set_mitigation)\nVariant_radio.on_clicked(set_variant)\nsCon.on_changed(update)  \nsHour.on_changed(update)\nsVax.on_changed(update)\nsTime.on_changed(update)","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-21T19:42:58.278796Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-21T19:42:58.279272Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
